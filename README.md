### Project description

Our team, as a part of TypeScript project, created chess game. Game window is made from two parts - 
game and settings. In settings we can introduce players names, select game time and choose whether we 
want game to show us possible moves or not. Each player has a game status bar, which dispalys each players
name, his or her time left and how many figures did the player took. Game offers  basic chess functions,
such as castling or en Passant. Game will force the player to defend King whenether he is under attack.
Game ends either while check mate or when one of the players will run out of time.
